## Cloning and Moving SVGOMG

To begin, you will need to clone the SVGOMG repository from GitHub. This can be done using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg
```

After cloning the repository, it's a good practice to move the cloned directory to a more appropriate location on your system. In this case, moving it to `/opt` is recommended as it is commonly used for installing software packages that are not part of the default distribution.

To move the SVGOMG directory to `/opt`, use the following command:

```bash
sudo mv ./svgomg /opt
```

This command requires superuser privileges, hence the use of `sudo`. It moves the entire SVGOMG directory from its current location to `/opt`.

## Next Steps

Once you have moved the SVGOMG directory to `/opt`, you can proceed with setting up and configuring the application according to your needs. This may involve installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, or setting up any necessary services.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and use SVGOMG after moving it to `/opt`, please refer to the official documentation provided in the repository.
